## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
Our team took on the task of developing a user-friendly quiz application using Node Express. Below, you can see the key steps we followed in the planning and problem-solving process to ensure the success of our project.
- Brainstormed ideas as a group to create an appealing and interesting quiz web application.
- Identified the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) criteria and established additional features for future development.
- Utilised the Trello app to track and manage the progress of individual tasks, including crafting thoughtful user stories together as a team (as seen in the to-do column of Trello in the image below).
- Assigned tasks to team members based on their individual expertise and skills.
- Conducted regular testing to ensure the proper functioning of the application after making changes.
- Collaboratively resolved coding errors by utilising Zoom screensharing for quick and efficient problem-solving.
- Celebrated smaller milestones throughout the project to motivate and encourage team members.
- Leveraged the unique strengths and expertise of each team member to optimise productivity and efficiency.

## :rocket: Cool tech
- **Programming Languages**: The project utilises CSS, JavaScript, and HTML to create an interactive web application. These languages allow for dynamic content and provide a solid foundation for building engaging user interfaces.
- **CSS Animations**: To enhance the user experience, CSS animations have been implemented. These animations add visual appeal and make the application more interactive and engaging.
- **Background Music**: A background music feature has been incorporated into the web application. It adds ambiance and immerses users in the quiz-taking experience, creating a more enjoyable atmosphere.
- **Feedback Sounds and Visual Indicators**: When a user answers a question, the application provides immediate feedback. A correct sound plays when the answer is right, while a wrong sound plays when the answer is incorrect. Additionally, the question card turns green for correct answers and red for incorrect ones. This combination of auditory and visual cues enhances user understanding and engagement.
- **Correct Answer Display**: To assist users in learning from their mistakes, the application displays the correct answer when a user gets a question wrong. This helps users understand the correct solution and encourages learning from their previous attempts.
- **Score Counter**: The web application features a score counter that keeps track of the user's score as they progress through the quiz. Once all questions have been attempted, the final score and percentage are provided. This feedback allows users to evaluate their performance and track their improvement over time.
- **API Integration**: The application leverages an API to access quizzes. This integration enables users to access a wide range of quiz content and ensures the availability of diverse question sets.
- **Quiz Management**: Users have the ability to create, edit, and delete quiz information within the application. This functionality provides a comprehensive solution that allows users to customise and tailor their quiz-taking experience.
- **User Authentication and Session Management**: The application includes user authentication features, allowing users to log in, sign up, and log out using sessions and cookies. This ensures the security of user data and provides a personalised experience by maintaining user-specific settings and progress.
By utilising these technologies and implementing these improvements, the project offers an engaging and user-friendly quiz-taking experience, enabling users to enhance their knowledge and have fun in the process.

## :scream: Bugs to fix :hankey:
- **Error Message on Incorrect Answer**: When a user gets an answer wrong, an error message appears in the console. Although it does not affect the app's functionality, it should be resolved to provide a seamless user experience.
- **Score Counter Visibility**: If a user begins taking a quiz and changes screens, the score counter remains visible. It should disappear to avoid confusion and maintain a consistent user interface.
- **Individual Question Submission**: Users are required to submit each question individually, which can become tedious. Implementing a mechanism to allow users to submit the entire quiz at once would improve user convenience.
- **Long Quizzes Impact User Experience**: If the quiz contains too many questions, it can result in a lengthy experience, making it less likely for users to complete the quiz and view their final results. Consider implementing a pagination or progress tracking feature to improve the usability of longer quizzes.
- **Background Music Controls**: Currently, the background music starts automatically when any button is clicked, and there are no controls to turn off the music or adjust its volume. This lack of control can be annoying for users. Provide options to toggle the music on/off and adjust the volume to give users more control over their audio experience.
By addressing these bugs, the functionality, usability, and overall user experience of the web application would be greatlyenhanced.

## :sob: Lessons learnt
During the development of this project, several valuable lessons were learned. If given the opportunity to complete the project again, the following improvements would be considered:
- **Thorough Planning and Idea Exploration**: Taking more time to plan and think through ideas would allow for better anticipation of potential scenarios and edge cases. By considering a wider range of possibilities during the planning phase, it becomes easier to build the project correctly from the beginning, rather than making significant changes after the code is already written.
- **Frequent Committing and File Management**: Establishing a better system for committing code frequently and managing files effectively is crucial. This practice helps prevent conflicts and ensures that work can be synchronised smoothly. By committing code regularly, it becomes easier to track changes and roll back if necessary.
- **Prioritise Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Development**: Focusing on building the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) before adding additional features is essential. It is important to ensure that the core functionality of the application is robust and well-implemented before dedicating time to CSS styling or incorporating extra features. This approach allows for a solid foundation and avoids unnecessary complexities during development.
- **Iterative Development and Testing**: Adopting an iterative development approach can greatly improve the overall quality of the project. Regular testing and refinement at each iteration ensure that issues are identified and resolved early on, leading to a more stable and reliable application.
By implementing these lessons learned, future projects can benefit from a more efficient and effective development process, resulting in higher-quality software and an improved overall experience for both developers and users.
