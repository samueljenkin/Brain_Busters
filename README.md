## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving

- # Approach to the problem:
 Our problem was to make a user friendly app to entertain users by making them take on an interesting quiz.
	- Group discussion to jot down the ideas for making the application look appealing and interesting to users.
	- keeping account of MVP(Minimum Viable Product) Criteria.
	- Making the list for the additional features that can be added.
	- Assigning tasks within group.
	- Making use of Trello app for keeping track of individual tasks that are in progress or complete.
	- Regulary testing the app after making changes to ensure the proper functioning of the application.
	- Solving an error in code by Screensharing through Zoom to make it easy and quick.
	- Celebrating smaller milestones to motivate each team member.
	- Leveraging the strengths of indiviual team member expertise and skills.



- Add screenshots/drawings of doodles/plans during the planning phase.
- Flow charts of app logic.
